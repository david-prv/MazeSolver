# MazeSolver

A Paper 1.20.6 plugin to solve a maze puzzle that was created for me as a part of my birthday gift. The program needed to find a path through the maze and use the blocks on the ground to reconstruct a bytes array. These bytes then can be used to recover an ASCII string that unlocked the next stage of the challenge.
